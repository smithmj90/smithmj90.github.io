	<img class="resize" id="fl" src="../assets/images/ProfilePic.jpg" alt="Matt Smith">

		<p>My name is Matt Smith and I am a participant in the 2017 UNC Coding Bootcamp. I live in Raleigh, North Carolina and love the area. Web Development and coding in general is gaining more importance in the world and I figured now is as good a time as ever to start learning. I am feeling the entire spectrum of emotion by taking this class and expect to grow a lot, both personally and professionally.</p>

		<p>Currently, I am working at a primary research firm in downtown Raleigh. Outside of coding, I love hiking, traveling, sports, going to concerts, and playing with my dog, Ruby.</p>
